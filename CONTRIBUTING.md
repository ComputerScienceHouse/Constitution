## I Found An Issue In The Constitution

Ooh, awesome, nice find!

Before reporting the issue, it is best to search through the issues list and double-check to make sure the issue does not overlap with any existing issues. If it does, it is generally recommended adding a comment on an existing issue.

Otherwise, create a new issue using the Constitution Issue template:

- In the title, include a descriptive name for the issue and, if possible, where the issue occurs in the current binding CSH Constitution (eg, the one at constitution.csh.rit.edu).
- Mark whether the issue reflects a semantic or non-semantic change to the Constitution.
- Include a short description of the issue. Include an excerpt of the language that is most in question.

Once you've created a title and description for the issue, add any relevant lablels. Several labels are available for application. Some commonly used labels for issues are:

- `needs-discussion`: for issues that are ready for discussion at committee meetings.
- `discussion-issue`: for issues that contain longer-term discussions not ready for discussion at a committee meeting.
- `question`: for issues where further information is requested.

We'll leave the assignees section blank until the issue has been picked up and under development.

Once your issue has a title, description, and labels, it is all set! Congrats üéâ

## I Have a Question

If you have a general question about the Constitution, ask a Maintainer (@constitutionalmaintainers on slack) or during a Committee meeting.

If you find a section of the Constitution that requires interpretation or clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new), as described [above](#i-found-an-issue-in-the-constitution).
- Add the `question` label.

## I Want To Fix An Issue

First, find an issue on the Constitution GitHub that you'd like to work on (or, alternatively, [create one](#i-found-an-issue-in-the-constitution) üòÉ). 

Next, assign the issue to yourself (and any others working on the issue) to indicate that the issue has been picked up and is under development.

Then, make a branch from main containing the issue number and a description of the changes in the form `issue_number-issue-description`, (eg, `3-add-anti-discrimination-policy`). 

On the branch, modify `constitution.tex` to resolve the issue and commit your changes. Then, push to your branch and make a Pull Request on GitHub using the PR template.

Title your PR in the form `Resolve #Issue_Number Issue-Description` (eg, `Resolve #14 Potential Issue with Privacy in Judicials`). In the PR description, mark if this is a semantic or non-semantic change, and provide a summary of the changes made in your PR. 

Lastly, assign the PR to yourself, and add any relevant labels (for example - `ready for review`). Your PR is now ready for review!

## I Want To Review A PR

Yo, that's awesome! First, add yourself as a reviewer on the PR.

Next, review the changes made in the PR. If you have questions or concerns about any of the changes, submit a review by going to `Files Changed`, highlighting the line in question, and hitting the `+`.

Once you've reviewed all the changes, under the `Files Changed` tab, hit the `Review Changes` button. Write a general review of the changes. If the changes are ready for finalization, hit `Approve` to let the author know the changes are ready to be merged. Otherwise, hit `Request Changes` to request changes from the author prior to merging.

## Guide - Making Changes To The Constitution

1. Create a local copy of the repository.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/rhochgraf21/Constitution.git
    ```

2. Check that you are not on an issue branch.
    
    ```
    git branch
    ```
    
    To switch branches, run:
    
    ```
    git switch <branch_name>
    ```

3. Install dependencies.
    
    Installing dependencies on debian
    
    ```
    sudo apt install texlive texlive-formats-extra make
    ```
    
    Installing depencdencies on fedora
    
    ```
    sudo yum install texlive make
    ```

4. Checkout a new development branch.

    ```
    git checkout -b <branch_name>
    ```

    Follow the branch naming convention found in [I Want To Fix An Issue](#i-want-to-fix-an-issue).

5. Make any changes to `constitution.tex` and save the file once ready.

6. Compile the LaTeX document. 
    
    ```
    make
    ```
    
    Visually inspect the generated PDF document to ensure your changes are correct.

7. Make a commit that includes your changes.

    ```
    git add constitution.tex
    git commit
    ```
    
    See the [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines) for more information on writing commit messages. 

8. Make a Pull Request

    > Double-check to ensure that your PR is made against the main branch of the `rhochgraf21/Constitution` project, not the upstream `ComputerScienceHouse/Constitution`.
    
    Using the github cli:
    
    ```
    gh pr create
    ```
    
    Or, using standard git:
    
    ```
    git push
    # now go to github.com/rhochgraf21/Constitution > Pull Requests > New Pull Request
    ```
    
    For instructions on making a Pull Request, see [I Want To Fix An Issue](#i-want-to-fix-an-issue).

Yay! Congrats, your PR is now ready for review! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Commit Guidelines

```
Capitalized + short (80 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to 80 characters.

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

Paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too.
- For this project, commit messages will generally be a single line.
```
