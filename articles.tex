% ARTICLE I - INTRODUCTION
\article{Introduction}

\asection{Name}
The name of this Special Interest House shall be Computer Science House.

\asection{Derivation of Authority}
The Computer Science House shall recognize that it receives its right to function as a Special Interest House from the Department of Residence Life in conjunction with the Residence Halls Association.

\asection{House Objectives}
The objectives of Computer Science House are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To enhance the education experience of its members.
	\item To offer students educational programming with an emphasis in computers.
	\item To provide a variety of services for its members, the RIT campus, and the Rochester Community.
	\item To provide a friendly and comfortable living environment in the residence halls.
\end{enumerate}

% ARTICLE II - CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE
\article{Constitutional Structure}

\asection{House Charter}
The House Charter is a document drafted by the department of Residence Life, setting down the guidelines within which this House operates and from which it derives its authority.

\asection{Constitution}
The House Constitution is written and maintained by the House and defines the major aspects, goals, and governing structure of the house.
It is reviewed annually by the Department of Residence Life.
The House Constitution is comprised of two sections: articles and by-laws.
Articles define the major aspects of the House.
A by-law may expand on rules outlined in an article, but they must never contradict a Constitutional article.

\asubsection{Non-Semantic Changes}
There are two methods for non-semantic change to the Constitution.
A Maintainer may approve any proposed change that does not affect the meaning of the document.
Alternatively, the change may be presented to the House for discussion followed by an Immediate Vote.
A quorum of fifty percent of the Total Number of Possible Votes is required for passage.

\asubsection{Semantic Changes}
Any semantic change to the Constitution requires the change to be proposed in writing for discussion at a House Meeting.
Any modifications made due to the discussion are added to the written proposal and the modified proposal is posted in the House during the week.
The final proposal is presented the following week and ballots are distributed for a ballot House vote as described in \ref{Balloted Vote}.
The ballots are collected for a minimum of a forty-eight hour period.
A quorum of two-thirds of the Total Number of Possible Votes must cast ballots for the vote to be official.
A vote equaling or exceeding two-thirds of the number of votes cast is required for the change to be placed into the constitution.
The Constitution may be overridden by an immediate House vote as described in \ref{Immediate Vote}.
There must be a quorum of eighty-five percent of the Total Number of Possible Votes for the vote to be official.
A vote equaling or exceeding ninety percent of the number of votes cast is required for the override to take effect.

\asection{Maintainers}

\asubsection{Maintainer Qualifications}
Maintainers must be Active or Alumni in good standing.

\asubsection{Maintainer Expectations}
Maintainers are expected to:
\begin{itemize}

	\item Participate in discussion of proposals.
	\item Facilitate the creation of new changes to the Constitution by other members.
	\item Be knowledgeable about the Constitution.
\end{itemize}
Failure to meet any of these expectations is grounds for revocation of Maintainer status by the Executive Board.

\asubsection{Maintainer Resignations}
Maintainers may resign at any time by notifying the current Executive Board and Maintainer group.

\asubsection{Maintainer Term}
Maintainer status lasts until it is resigned, or until it is revoked by Executive Board vote.

% ARTICLE V - VOTING
\article{Voting}
This section outlines the different types of votes and ballots used to make House decisions and defines relevant terminology.
\asection{Definitions}

\asubsection{Total Number of Votes Cast}
The Total Number of Votes Cast is defined as the total number of votes received for every voting option minus the number of abstentions.
\asubsection{Quorum}
A Quorum is defined by the minimum number of votes cast required for a vote to be official.
It is a fraction or a percentage of the total number of possible votes.
Any member present for an Immediate Vote or given a ballot who does not explicitly cast their vote is counted as an Abstention.
A Quorum is reached if the Total Number of Votes Cast plus the number of Abstentions is equal to or exceeding the minimum number of votes required.
\asubsection{Proxy Ballot}
A Proxy Vote is defined as any ballot that was cast by one member on behalf of another member.
Any member may cast a Proxy Vote for another member who is unable to actually participate in the vote.
A Proxy Vote must be explicitly written down and signed by the member not in attendance.
The count of all Proxy Vote must be recorded and announced in all votes.
Proxy Votes are only permissible where explicitly stated, at the discretion of the person chairing the vote.
\asubsection{Abstention}
An Abstention is defined as a vote indicating a neutral position in the vote.
A means to abstain must always be provided in a vote.
Abstentions are counted towards a Quorum, but not towards the Total Number of Votes Cast used to determine if a vote passes or not.
\asubsection{Vote Counters}
Vote Counters are the chairperson of the vote, and two randomly selected members.

\asection{Types of Voting}
\asubsection{Alternative Vote}
\asubsubsection{Method of Vote}
Votes are cast on paper ballots, which provide a means to indicate every possible option in the vote.
A ballot is then distributed to each House member eligible to cast a vote and collected in the designated ballot box for a pre-specified length of time.
At the end of the voting period, the person chairing the vote collects the ballots, closing the voting period.
The Vote Counters then tally the results.

Voters rank the options by placing a '1' by their first choice, a '2' by their second choice, and so on, until they no longer wish to express any further preferences or run out of options.

\asubsubsection{Voting Period} 
For constitutional modification, candidate selection, and officer removal votes, the voting period must be at least forty-eight (48) hours in length.
For any other type of vote, the voting period must be at least twenty-four (24) hours.
The minimum length of the voting period may be explicitly lengthened, but never shortened, in the text describing the actual vote.
\asubsection{Balloted Vote}
\asubsubsection{Method of Vote}

An immediate vote lasts as long as it takes for all votes to be tallied.
\asubsection{Secret Immediate Vote}
\asubsubsection{Method of Vote}

Votes are kept anonymous.
The chairing member and Vote Counters will count the number of members casting their immediate vote for that possibility.
\asubsubsection{Voting Period}
A secret immediate vote lasts as long as it takes for all votes to be tallied.
\asubsection{Batch Vote}
When a Batch Vote is called for by the chair, a subset of the voting docket may be amended to a single vote.
A Two-Thirds Immediate Vote is required to allow a Batch Vote to take place.
If the call for Batch Vote passes, the subset may then be voted on, otherwise the docket remains unchanged.

\asection{Number of Votes Required}
The Number of Votes Required refers to the numbers required to achieve a quorum and for a vote to pass.
Below are listed four standard votes.
Numbers for non-standard votes are defined in the section describing the actual vote.
\asubsection{Simple Majority}
In a Simple Majority Vote, a Quorum is reached if the Total Number of Votes Cast is equal to or exceeds one-half the Total Number of Possible Votes.
An option in the vote passes if the number of votes cast for that option is larger than the number of votes cast for every other option individually.
\asubsection{Fifty Percent}
In a Fifty Percent Vote, a Quorum is reached if the Total Number of Votes Cast is equal to or exceeds one-half the Total Number of Possible Votes.
An option in the vote passes if the number of votes cast for that option exceeds fifty percent of the Total Number of Votes Cast.
\asubsection{Two-Thirds}
In a Two-thirds Vote, a Quorum is reached if the Total Number of Votes Cast is equal to or exceeds two-thirds the Total Number of Possible Votes.
An option in the vote passes if the number of votes cast for the option equals or exceeds two-thirds of the Total Number of Votes Cast.
\asubsection{Three Tiered}
When voting on a set of three choices where each choice can be ranked in a definite order, a selection for either the lowest or highest option will only pass if the votes cast for that selection exceed fifty percent of the Total Number of Votes Cast.
If neither the highest or lowest selection exceeds fifty percent, the middle option will then automatically be passed.
In a Three-Tiered Vote, a Quorum is reached if the Total Number of Votes Cast is equal to or exceeds two-thirds of the Total Number of Possible Votes.

\asubsection{Alternative}
The winning option is selected outright if it gains more than half the votes collected as a first preference.
If not, the option with the fewest number of first preference votes is eliminated and their votes move to the second preference marked on the ballot papers.
This process continues until one option has half of the votes collected and is elected.

\asection{Ties Between Vote Options}
\asubsection{With Pass/Fail}
If the number of votes cast for the pass option equals the number of votes cast for the fail option, then the vote has failed.
\asubsection{With Multiple Options}
If multiple options may pass, a tie does not present a problem.
If only one option may pass, then the vote must be recast or tabled at the discretion of the person chairing the vote.
In the event of a tie in an Executive Board vote, the Chairman may cast the tie-breaking vote.

% ARTICLE VI - JUDICIAL
\article{Judicial}
The Executive Board may approve (by simple majority) a request (from a member) for a Judicial proceeding when an official clarification of the Constitution or By-Laws is required, there is a conflict among House Members, or a House interest needs resolution.
\asection{Formation of a Judicial Board}
A Judicial Board is made up of the Chairman, the Evaluations director, and an additional voting member of the Executive Board chosen by a majority vote among the Executive Board.
If either the Chairman or Evaluations Director are deemed biased or unfit for a position on the Judicial Board, they will be replaced by another voting member of the Executive Board by means of a simple majority vote amongst the remaining Executive Board members.
\asection{Judicial Investigation}
The Judicial Board will be responsible for making all necessary inquiries into the matter of the request brought to the Judicial Board.
\asection{Judicial Ruling}
The Judicial Board may present an official ruling following the Judicial Investigation.
This ruling may be appealed in the same manner as an Executive Board decision \ref{Appeals}.
