# CSH Constitution
The master branch's HEAD is the current legal constitution of CSH.

Compiled version of both documents can be found below:
#### [Articles](https://constitution.csh.rit.edu/articles.pdf)
#### [By-Laws](https://constitution.csh.rit.edu/bylaws.pdf)

## Modifying the Constitution
**Do not** make changes to master without their passing the proper house voting
procedures. (At the very least, not text changes, anyways)

You can demo changes etc on forks or branches though. In fact, the diff of this
branch/fork and the head of constitution/master would make it extremely easy to
illustrate the changes you've made relative to the current constitution, or for
people to annotate your changes with comments, etc.

# Contributing to the CSH Constitution
