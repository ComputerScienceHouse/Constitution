\asection{Name}
The name of this Special Interest House is Computer Science House.

\asection{Derivation of Authority}
CSH shall recognize that it receives its right to function as a Special Interest House from the Center for Campus Life and the Department of Residence Life.

\asection{House Objectives}
The objectives of CSH are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To enhance the education experience of its members
	\item To offer students educational programming with an emphasis in computers

% ARTICLE 3 - CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE
\article{Constitutional Structure and Amendment}

\asection{Constitution}
The CSH Constitution is written and maintained by members and defines the major aspects, goals, and governing structure of CSH.
\\*\\
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the requirements and expectations defined in the Constitution are for the Standard Operating Session.

\subsection{Modifiying the Constitution}
\asubsection{Non-Semantic Changes}
There are two methods for non-semantic change to the Constitution.
A Maintainer may approve any proposed change that does not affect the meaning of the document.
Alternatively, the change may be presented at a House Meeting for discussion followed by an Immediate One-Half Vote with fifty percent quorum.

\asubsection{Semantic Changes}
Any semantic change to the Constitution requires the change to be proposed in writing for discussion at a House Meeting.
Any modifications made due to the discussion are added to the written proposal and the modified proposal is posted in during the week.
The final proposal is presented the following week and ballots are distributed for a Balloted Two-Thirds Vote with two-thirds quorum \ref{Balloted Vote}.
The ballots are collected for a minimum of a forty-eight hour period.
A quorum of two-thirds of Eligible Votes must cast ballots for the vote to be official.
A vote equaling or exceeding two-thirds of the number of Votes Cast is required for the change to be placed into the Constitution.
The Constitution may be overridden by an Immediate Nine-Tenths Vote with eighty-five percent quorum as described in \ref{Immediate Vote}.

% ARTICLE 4 - MEMBERSHIP

% ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP EVALUATIONS
\asubsubsection{Evaluations Processes}
During the academic year, an Active Member is evaluated by the Membership Eval.
The Membership Eval is responsible for determining those individuals who will have the option to continue Active Membership in the following year.
These meetings are open only to Active Members.
All Active Members are expected to attend the these Evals meetings.
\\* \\*
At the beginning of any Eval Process listed herein, the Evals Director must read the sections of the CSH Constitution used during the respective Eval Process.
It is incumbent upon each member to provide the Evals Director with whatever information they feel is necessary to ensure an accurate evaluation.

\asubsubsubsubsection{Voting}
Any Active Member who has completed all of the requirements as defined in \ref{Expectations of Active Members} at the beginning of the Membership Eval passes their Membership Eval without being voted on.
All Active Members who have not recieved an exemption from E-Board prior to the Membership Eval will be evaluated on a member by member basis by Active Members.
The Membership Eval shall hold members to the objective requirements defined in \ref{Expectations of Active Members} and determine which members may continue as an Active Member in the following academic year.
Exceptions to the requirements may be made, as attending members may choose any of the outcomes for each member, even if the member being evaluated has not completed all of their requirements.
These requirements must be completed before the Membership Eval occurs.
A Secret Immediate Relative Majority vote with two-thirds quorum is required for the evaluation to be valid.
Neither absentee nor proxy votes are allowed.

\asubsubsubsubsection{Outcomes}
Members who pass the Membership Eval have the option to participate as an Active Member in the following year.
\\* \\*
If a member fails and has never passed a Membership Eval in the past, their membership will be revoked immediately.
If the member fails, but has previously passed a Membership Eval, they will move to Alumni Membership in bad standing, as defined in \ref{Alumni Membership Selection}, at the end of the Standard Operating Session.
In either case, the member forfeits their ability to participate as an Active Member in the following year.
\\* \\*
A member may be given a conditional to complete as a means of making up for missing requirements.
A conditional may be proposed by any member present at the Eval.
If the conditional is approved by the Evals Director, it is then voted on by the attending members as described in \ref{Voting}.
Each conditional consists of a set of additional requirements a deadline for completing them.
Members who are given a conditional have their Eval decision deferred, and therefore maintain their current membership status until the conditional is resolved.
When the deadline expires, the conditional will be brought before E-Board, who will assess its completeness.
A conditional member who does not meet these additional requirements will have failed the Eval.

\asubsubsubsection{Appeals Process}
If a member disagrees with the outcome of any Eval and wishes to appeal the decision, they may do so as stated in \ref{Appeals}.

\asubsection{Selection}

\asubsubsection{Dual Directors}
Social and R\&D are the only voting E-Board positions that allow for dual directors.

If two candidates elect to run as dual directors, their names are placed together on a single line of the election ballot.
If they are also nominated as a single directorship or as dual directors with another member, their votes are not cumulative.
Each different nomination must be a separate entry on the election ballot.
Ad Hoc Directors are not restricted to single or dual directors.

The following special cases cover the operation of dual directors:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If one of the members in a dual directorship resigns, or for any other reason ends the term of office, the other member in the dual directorship must also step down and the office becomes vacated.
	      The vacated office is then handled like any other vacated office, as referenced in \ref{Executive Board Resignations}.
	\item During an official E-Board Vote, each dual director's vote counts for one half of a vote in the tallying of votes.
	      The members of the dual directorship need not vote the same way in a vote.
	      This cannot be used to give a vote to a position that would not otherwise have one in an E-Board Vote.
	\item A member of a dual directorship may not hold any other Voting E-Board position or the position of Chair.
	      When attendance requirements call for the dual directorship position to be present, at least one of the dual directors must be present to fulfill the requirements.

	      In addition, an area will be provided to indicate a write-in selection of a candidate.
	\item At the end of the voting period, the Chair will terminate voting.
	\item The winners are determined via the process described in \ref{Ranked Choice}.
	      A fifty-percent quorum is required for the election to be official.

	      If the majority of E-Board votes are negative, the petition and impeachment proceedings are dismissed.
	      This vote may be overridden by an impeachment petition consisting of the grounds for impeachment and a minimum of number of signatures of current members equaling or exceeding two-thirds the number of Eligible Votes.

The amount of dues for Active Members will be eighty dollars per academic semester.

\asubsection{Collection of Dues}
The collection period of house dues will be decided in conjunction with the Center for ResLife and Housing Operations.
During the dues collection period, dues for both semesters are collected through the member’s RIT bill.
Dues for any Alumni in good standing are to be collected when intention to pay is expressed to the Financial Director.

\asubsubsection{Rules for Giving Exceptions and Exemptions for House Dues}
If a member is unable to pay requested dues, they may appeal their situation to the Financial Director.
The Financial Director then decides whether their situation warrants an extension to the payment deadline and/or reduction of the required dues.
If the Financial Director decides their situation warrants no action, the member may appeal this decision to E-Board.
If appealed, E-Board may provide an extension and/or reduction to the member.
If the appeal is denied, the member’s payment is considered delinquent and the member’s privileges are revoked until payment can be made.
All dues must be collected in full before the annual Membership Eval, as defined in \ref{Membership Evaluation}.
After this date, dues collection is suspended until the start of the next academic year.

% The suggested total operating budget is $8360.
% This figure comes from having approximately 55 on-floor members with $80 per semester dues (totaling $8800) minus 5% set aside for Accumulated.
Dues collected from on-floor members are to be distributed into directorship budgets as shown in the above table.
Money allocated for Accumulated or collected from off-floor members is deposited into the CSH account and saved.

All CSH expenditures must be approved by the Financial Director and the director whose budget is going to be used for the expenditure.
Single expenditures may not exceed seventy-five dollars and Total Expenditures may not exceed one-hundred dollars.
\\* \\*
If the above amounts are to be exceeded, the expenditure must be approved by an Immediate One-Half Vote at a House Meeting before the funds may be appropriated.
At the Financial Director's discretion, a Spending Committee meeting may be held in order to approve any purchase exceeding one-hundred dollars, but not to exceed three-hundred dollars.
A Two-Thirds Immediate Vote with twenty-five percent quorum is required to approve the purchase.
\\*\\*
For expenditures exceeding \$300 in total funding, a spending presentation must be presented to at a House Meeting.
This presentation includes the funds required for the expenditure, inventory of required resources, and, if applicable, a timeline for completion.
\\* \\*
If an appropriate directorship cannot be determined for an expenditure, it is to be brought up for approval at House Meeting as a miscellaneous expenditure and approved by an Immediate Relative Majority vote with fifty percent quorum, regardless of the amount.
This amount is to be directly subtracted from the general CSH account.

\asubsection{Ranked Choice}
In a Ranked Choice Vote, voters rank the options by placing a '1' by their first choice, a '2' by their second choice, and so on, until they no longer wish to express any further preferences or run out of options.

The winning option is selected outright if it gains more than half the votes cast as a first preference.
If not, the option with the fewest number of first preference votes is eliminated and their votes move to the second preference marked on the ballots.
This process continues until one option has half of the votes cast and is elected.

\asection{Ties Between Vote Options}

\asubsection{With Pass/Fail}
If the number of votes cast for the pass option equals the number of votes cast for the fail option, then the vote has failed.
