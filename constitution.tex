\article{Introduction}

\asection{Name}
The name of this Special Interest House is Computer Science House.

\asection{Derivation of Authority}
The Computer Science House shall recognize that it receives its right to function as a Special Interest House from the Center for Residence Life.

\asection{House Objectives}
The objectives of Computer Science House are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To enhance the education experience of its members
	\item To offer students educational programming with an emphasis in computers

% ARTICLE II - CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE
\article{Constitutional Structure}

\asection{Constitution}
The House Constitution is written and maintained by the House and defines the major aspects, goals, and governing structure of the house.

\asubsection{Non-Semantic Changes}
There are two methods for non-semantic change to the Constitution.
A Maintainer may approve any proposed change that does not affect the meaning of the document.
Alternatively, the change may be presented to the House for discussion followed by an Immediate Vote.
A quorum of fifty percent of the Total Number of Possible Votes is required for passage.

\asubsection{Semantic Changes}
Any semantic change to the Constitution requires the change to be proposed in writing for discussion at a House Meeting.
Any modifications made due to the discussion are added to the written proposal and the modified proposal is posted in the House during the week.
The final proposal is presented the following week and ballots are distributed for a ballot House vote as described in \ref{Balloted Vote}.
The ballots are collected for a minimum of a forty-eight hour period.
A quorum of two-thirds of the Total Number of Possible Votes must cast ballots for the vote to be official.
A vote equaling or exceeding two-thirds of the number of votes cast is required for the change to be placed into the constitution.
The Constitution may be overridden by an immediate House vote as described in \ref{Immediate Vote}.
There must be a quorum of eighty-five percent of the Total Number of Possible Votes for the vote to be official.
A vote equaling or exceeding ninety percent of the number of votes cast is required for the override to take effect.

\end{itemize}
Failure to meet any of these expectations is grounds for revocation of Maintainer status by the Executive Board.

\asubsection{Maintainer Term}
Maintainer status lasts until it is resigned, or until it is revoked by Executive Board vote.
A Maintainer may resign at any time by notifying the current Executive Board and Maintainer group.

\asection{Operations}
\asubsection{Operations of the Financial Directorship}
\asubsubsection{Amount of House Dues}
The amount of dues for Active Members will be eighty dollars (\$80.00) per Academic Semester.
\asubsubsection{Collection of House Dues}
The collection period of house dues will be decided in conjunction with The Center for Residence Life and Housing Operations.
During the dues collection period, dues for on-floor members (for both semesters) are collected through the member’s RIT bill.
Dues for off-floor members are to be collected during this period as well by the Financial Director.
For any member who moves on or off-floor during the year, any difference between dues paid and dues owed should be collected.
Dues for any alumnus/alumnae in good standing are to be collected when intention to pay is expressed to the Financial Director.
\asubsubsubsection{Rules for Giving Exceptions and Exemptions for House Dues}
If a member is unable to pay dues upon request, they may appeal their situation to the Financial Director.
If the Financial Director deems their situation appropriate, they may grant specific extensions or reductions of the member's payment as they see fit.
If the Financial Director deems their situation inappropriate for extension, the member may appeal to the Executive Board.
If the Executive Board disagrees with the Financial Director, the Executive Board may reduce the required payment or extend the payment deadline.
If the Executive Board agrees with the Financial director, the member’s payment is considered delinquent and the member’s privileges are revoked until payment can be made.
In the case the Financial Director or Executive Board decides the situation is appropriate, the member's dues may be partially or fully excused, or the member may be given additional time to pay their dues. 
Additional time and reduction of dues may both be given to a member in an appropriate situation.
All dues must be collected in full before the annual membership evaluation (\ref{Membership Evaluation}).
After this date, dues collection is suspended until the start of the next academic year.
\asubsubsection{Breakdown of Dues for Directorship Budgets}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[c]{|l c|}
\hline
Directorship Name & Percentage of Dues \\
\hline
\hline
Operational Communications & 20\% \\
\hline
Evaluations & 5\% \\
\hline
House History & 10\% \\
\hline
House Improvements & 15\% \\
\hline
Research and Development & 20\% \\
\hline
Social & 20\% \\
\hline
Public Relations & 5\% \\
\hline
Accumulated & 5\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

% The suggested total operating budget is $8360.
% This figure comes from having approximately 55 on-floor members with $80 per semester dues (totaling $8800) minus 5% set aside for Accumulated.

Dues collected from on-floor members are to be distributed into directorship budgets as shown in the above table.
Money allocated for Accumulated or collected from off-floor members is deposited into the CSH Account and saved.

\asubsubsection{Expenditure Approval}
All House expenditures must be approved by both the Financial Director and the appropriate Director (from whose budget the funds will be drawn).
Single expenditures may not exceed seventy-five dollars (\$75) and total expenditures may not exceed one-hundred dollars (\$100).
A total expenditure is defined as all the funds drawn for a specific event, project, piece of equipment, or service.
\\* \\*
If the above amounts are to be exceeded, the expenditure must be approved by a Simple Majority vote at House meeting before the funds may be appropriated, as defined in \ref{Simple Majority}.
At the Financial Director's discretion, a Spending Committee meeting may be held in order to approve any purchase exceeding one-hundred dollars (\$100), but not to exceed three-hundred dollars (\$300).
A quorum of one-quarter the number of current active members is required for the meeting to take place and for any vote to be considered valid, it must be passed by a simple two-thirds majority.
\\*\\*
For expenditures exceeding \$300 in total funding, a Complete Project Proposal must be presented to House at a House meeting.
This proposal includes the project budget, inventory of required resources, and a timeline for completion.
\\* \\*
If an appropriate Directorship cannot be determined for an expenditure, it is to be brought up for approval at House meeting as a Miscellaneous expenditure and approved by a simple majority vote, regardless of the amount.
This amount is to be directly subtracted from the general CSH account.
\\* \\*
Funds allocated for a project not spent by the end of the Standard Operating Session \ref{Standard Operating Session} in which they were approved are voided, unless otherwise specified during the original voting process.

	Then a simple majority vote, of attending members, is held on whether or not to accept the person as an Introductory Member.
\end{enumerate}
Note: Most membership privileges do not initiate until successful completion of the introductory process.
This means that until the member has passed the Introductory Evaluation, the member does NOT have the right to vote on House issues and does NOT count towards quorum.
The member does, however, have the right to use Computer Science House's facilities.
The member is not required to pay dues during the Introductory Process.
\\* \\*
Additional Note: No hazing shall occur at any time during the Selection Process in accordance with the New York State Hazing Laws.

            A subset of Introductory Members will be offered On-Floor status and will be able to select a room on floor. 
            The other Introductory Members will have Off-Floor status, but will otherwise have the same privileges and responsibilities.
\end{enumerate}
Note: Most membership privileges do not initiate until successful completion of the introductory process.
This means that until the member has passed the Introductory Evaluation, the member does NOT have the right to vote on House issues and does NOT count towards quorum.
The member does, however, have the right to use Computer Science House's facilities.

\end{enumerate}

\asubsubsection{Evaluations Processes}
During the academic year, a House member is evaluated by the Membership Evaluation.
The Membership Evaluation is responsible for determining those individuals who will have the option to continue Active Membership in the following year.
Semi-Annual Evaluations Meetings are open only to current Active Members.
All Executive Board members are expected to attend the Semi-Annual Evaluations Meetings to assist in the evaluations of House members.
\\* \\*
At the beginning of any Evaluation Process listed herein, the Evaluations Director must read the sections of the Computer Science House Constitution used during the respective Evaluation Process.
It is incumbent upon each House member to provide the Evaluation Director with whatever information they feel is necessary to ensure an accurate evaluation.
\asubsubsubsection{Membership Evaluation}
The Membership Evaluation process occurs once per academic year.
It is performed as part of the Evaluation Process that takes place during the spring semester to comply with RIT Housing deadlines.
\asubsubsubsubsection{Voting}
Any Active Member who has completed all of the requirements as defined in \ref{Expectations of House Members} at the beginning of the Membership Evaluation passes their Membership Evaluation without being voted on or evaluated by the quorum.
All Active Members who have not recieved an exemption from the Executive Board prior to the Membership Evaluation will be evaluated on a Member by Member basis by a quorum of Active Members.
The Membership Evaluation shall hold members to the objective requirements defined in \ref{Expectations of House Members} and determine which members may continue as an Active Member in the following Standard Operating Session.
Exceptions to the requirements may be made, as House may choose any of the Outcomes for each Member, even if the Member being evaluated has not completed all of their requirements.
These requirements must be completed before the Membership Evaluation occurs.
A Secret Immediate Simple Majority vote with a Quorum of two-thirds of the Total Number of Possible Votes is required for the evaluation to be valid.
Neither absentee nor proxy votes are allowed.


\asubsubsubsubsection{Outcomes}
Members who pass Membership Evaluation have the option to participate as an Active Member in the following year and remain on the upcoming roster if applicable.
\\* \\*
If a member fails and has never passed a Membership Evaluation in the past, their membership will be revoked immediately.
If the member has previously passed a Membership Evaluation they will move to Alumni Membership status at the end of the Standard Operating Session (\ref{Alumni Membership Selection}).
In either case, the member forfeits their ability to be included on the following year’s roster.
\\* \\*
A member may be given a conditional to complete as a means of making up for missing requirements.
A conditional may be proposed by any member present at the Evaluation.
If the conditional is approved by the Evaluations Director, it is then voted on by House.
Each conditional consists of a set of additional requirements a deadline for completing them.
When the deadline expires, the conditional will be brought before the Executive Board who will assess its completeness.
A conditional member who does not meet these additional requirements will have failed the evaluation.
\asubsubsubsection{Appeals Process}
If a member disagrees with the outcome of any evaluation, (e.g. is not asked to return to the House for the following year) and wishes to appeal the decision, they may do so as stated in \ref{Appeals}.
\\* \\*
If the member is still unsatisfied after being heard by the Executive Board, the appeal may be brought to the attention of the ResLife Advisor.

\asubsubsection{Expectations of House Members}
Each member is required to pay House dues as stated in \ref{Collection of House Dues}, attend all House Meetings and Executive Board candidate speeches, and attend at least fifteen (15) of the House directorship meetings (including permanent and Ad Hoc directorship meetings) for each Academic Semester in which they are an Active Member.
\\* \\*
The member must participate significantly in at least one major project during the academic year.
The member is required to submit a description for this major project to the Executive Board for approval.
As an option to this requirement, the member may instead assist on a large number of House activities and projects.
However, it is to be understood in advance by the member that this option requires a great deal of participation throughout the year.
This participation will be evaluated by the Executive Board.

\asubsubsection{Housing Status}
All Alumni, Active, and Introductory Members have a housing status.
This status indicates their right to priority housing on the floor.
Alumni Members in good standing keep the housing status they had as Active Members.
Alumni Members in bad standing have Off-Floor status.
\asubsubsubsection{On-Floor Status}
Members with On-Floor status are eligible to live on the floor.
To be granted On-Floor status, members may notify the Evaluations Director that they would like to come up for a vote.
The Evaluations Director will then bring them up for vote at the next meeting.
\asubsubsubsection{Off-Floor Status}
Members with Off-Floor status do not have the right to live on the floor.
They still have access to all other privileges associated with their membership, and may still accumulate Housing Priority Points.

\asubsubsection{Housing Priority System}
The Housing Priority System is a means for determining the priority a House member has in a Housing issue such as Single Room Assignment or the Assignment of Available Housing.
The member with top priority is the member with on-floor status and the most Housing Priority Points.
Housing Priority Points are accumulated once per Operating Session at the conclusion of the Membership Evaluation. Each Active Member who passes the Membership Evaluation is granted two (2) Housing Priority Points.
\\* \\*
In the event of a tie, the members will be approached simultaneously and if they are unable to decide fairly between themselves, the assignment of priority will be made by random selection of the tied members.
\asubsubsubsection{Single Room Assignments}
When a single room on the House becomes available it is offered to the member who carries the highest Housing Priority as defined in \ref{Housing Priority System}.
In the event of a tie, the members will be approached simultaneously and if they are unable to decide fairly between themselves, the assignment of priority will be made by random selection of the tied members.
If that House member declines the option, it will be offered to the member with the next highest Housing Priority.
This process continues until a member selects to move into the single room.
Once in a single room, a House member retains the assignment until voluntarily giving it up.
It should be noted that members selecting this option must agree to any additional charges applied by the Department of Residence Life for residing in a single room.
\asubsubsubsection{Double Rooms as Single rooms}
During the third week of each semester, if there is no waiting list for residency on the House, any vacant rooms will be offered to House members as single rooms assignments according to the method as described in \ref{Single Room Assignments}.
It should be noted that this does not mean members will be relocated into empty spaces so that the member with top priority is offered the single.
This only applies if there is a totally vacant room.

\asubsection{Operations of the Operational Communications Directorship}
The Operational Communications Directorship is responsible for overseeing the implementation of maintenance and upgrades to the House Computer Systems Network.
