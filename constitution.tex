% ARTICLE III - CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE
\article{Constitutional Structure and Amendment}

\asection{Constitution}
The CSH Constitution is written and maintained by members and defines the major aspects, goals, and governing structure of CSH.
\\*\\
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the requirements and expectations defined in the Constitution are for the Standard Operating Session.

\subsection{Modifying the Constitution}
\asubsection{Non-Semantic Changes}
There are two methods for non-semantic change to the Constitution.
A Maintainer may approve any proposed change that does not affect the meaning of the document.
Alternatively, the change may be presented at a House Meeting for discussion followed by an Immediate One-Half Vote with fifty percent quorum.

\asubsection{Semantic Changes}
\asubsubsection{Amendments}
Any semantic change to the Constitution requires the change to be proposed in writing for discussion at a House Meeting.
Any modifications made due to the discussion are added to the written proposal and the modified proposal is posted during the week.
The final proposal is presented the following week, and ballots are distributed for a Balloted Two-Thirds Vote with two-thirds quorum as described in \ref{Balloted Vote}.
The ballots are collected for a minimum of a forty-eight hour period.
A quorum of two-thirds of Eligible Votes must cast ballots for the vote to be official.
A vote equaling or exceeding two-thirds of the number of Votes Cast is required for the change to be placed into the Constitution.
\asubsubsection{Compliance with RIT Policy and New York State Law}
Any change made to Article  \ref{ADHERENCE TO UNIVERSITY POLICIES} which is made due to an update in NY law or RIT policy may be treated as a Non-Semantic change.
 
\asubsubsection{Overrides}
The Constitution may be overridden by an Immediate Nine-Tenths Vote with eighty-five percent quorum as described in \ref{Immediate Vote}.

\asubsection{Introductory Membership Qualifications}
Intro Membership is open to all students currently enrolled at RIT, excluding all Active and Alumni Members.

\asubsection{Introductory Membership Selection}
Applicants notify the Evals Director of their interest in membership by submitting an application.
They then undergo the selection process as defined below.

\asubsubsection{Selection Process for Current RIT Students}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\arabic{enumi}} % For this section, we want items to use letters
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The applicant submits an application to the Evals Director for review.
	\item The applicant participates in an informal interview with three current Active, Alumni, or Honorary Members.
	\item The application materials are reviewed at an Evals meeting.
	      Then an Immediate Relative Majority Vote of attending members is held on whether or not to accept the person as an Intro Member.
\end{enumerate}

% Incoming RIT students is defined as students who have attended RIT for less than 1 full semester
\asubsubsection{Selection Process for Incoming RIT Students}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item During spring semester, the Evals Director selects a group of Active Members to form a Selections Committee.
	      The Selections Committee reviews applications in accordance with the process prescribed by ResLife.
	\item A subset of applicants will be offered Intro Membership and have the opportunity to participate in the Intro Process defined in \ref{The Evaluation Period}.
	      A subset of Intro Members will be offered On-Floor status and will be able to select a room on floor.
	      The other Intro Members will have Off-Floor status, but will otherwise have the same privileges and responsibilities.
\end{enumerate}

\asubsection{Introductory Membership Expectations}
Intro Members are expected to meet all the requirements of the Intro Process described in \ref{Expectations of an Introductory Member}.
Intro Members are not required to pay membership dues.

\asubsection{Introductory Membership Privileges}
Most membership privileges do not initiate until successful completion of the Intro Process.
This means that until the member has passed the Intro Eval, the member does not have the right to vote on CSH issues and does not count towards quorum.
The member does, however, have the privilege to use CSH's facilities.

\asubsection{Introductory Membership Evaluations}
The Intro Process allows Intro Members to learn about CSH and demonstrate their interest in becoming Active Members. During this period, Intro Members will meet members, learn CSH history, and be evaluated for Active Membership by Active Members.

% fix numbers to be only text
\asubsubsection{The Evaluation Period}
The Intro Process will occur either once or twice per semester, and will last for six weeks.
The process will be initiated by the Evals Director during either the first or second week of each semester. E-Board may approve an extension to the Intro Process by an E-Board Vote.
If an Intro Process is extended, the Intro Eval shall occur at the termination of the extended process, which may be outside of the period defined in \ref{Introductory Evaluation}.
If deemed necessary by the Evals Director or by an E-Board Vote, the second Intro Process must begin within nine days of the first process ending.
If a second Intro Process is approved, the Evals Director may initiate a new Intro Packet within the first or second week of the process.

\asubsubsection{The Introductory Packet}
Each Intro Process participant, after the first week, is given two weeks to obtain signatures from all Active and Intro Members, and ten of any combination of Alumni, Honorary, and Advisory Members.
At the discretion of the Evals Director or as the result of an E-Board Vote, any Intro Packet may be extended to accommodate extenuating circumstances.

\asubsubsection{Expectations of an Introductory Member}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\arabic{enumi}} % For this section, we want items to use numbers

\end{enumerate}

\asubsection{Introductory Membership Leave of Absence}
An Intro Member may request a Leave of Absence through the process described in \ref{Leave of Absence}.

\asubsection{Introductory Membership Resignations}
Intro Members may resign by submitting a request for termination of membership to the Chair or the Evals Director in writing before the completion of the Intro Process.

\\*\\*
Any Alumni Member in bad standing, as described in \ref{Alumni Membership Selection}, may become an Active Member by notifying the Evals Director of their intent to participate.
The Evals Director will then bring them up for an Immediate Relative Majority vote with fifty percent quorum at the next House Meeting.
If the vote passes, the Alumni is reinstated as an Active Member with Off-Floor Status effective immediately.

\asubsection{Active Membership Expectations}
Active Members are expected to be active participants in CSH as defined in \ref{Expectations of Active Members}.

They are also expected to sign a copy of the Membership Agreement.
\\* \\*
Active Members must participate in at least one major project during the academic year.
Members are required to submit a description for this major project to E-Board for approval.
As an alternative to this requirement, members may instead assist on a large number of CSH activities and projects.
However, it is to be understood in advance by the member that this option requires a great deal of participation throughout the year.
This participation will be evaluated by E-Board.

\asubsection{Active Membership Privileges}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Vote on CSH issues
	\item Hold a position on E-Board
	\item Use CSH facilities

\end{enumerate}

\asubsubsection{Expectations of Voting Members}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\arabic{enumi}} % For this section, we want items to use letters

	\item Attend at least two Technical Seminars
\end{enumerate}

\asubsection{Active Membership Evaluations}

% ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP EVALUATIONS
\asubsubsection{Membership Evaluation}
The Membership Eval occurs once per academic year, where Active Members are evaluated.
It is performed as part of the Eval Process that takes place during the spring semester to comply with the RIT Housing deadlines.
The Membership Eval is responsible for determining individuals who will have the option to continue Active Membership in the following academic year.
This meeting is open only to Active Members.
All Active Members are expected to attend this meeting.

\asubsubsubsection{Voting}
Any Active Member who has completed all of the requirements as defined in \ref{Expectations of Active Members} at the beginning of the Membership Eval passes their Membership Eval without being voted on.
All Active Members who have not received an exemption from E-Board prior to the Membership Eval will be evaluated on a member-by-member basis by Active Members.
The Membership Eval shall hold members to the objective requirements defined in \ref{Expectations of Active Members} and determine which members may continue as an Active Member in the following academic year.
Exceptions to the requirements may be made, as attending members may choose any of the outcomes for each member, even if the member being evaluated has not completed all of their requirements.
These requirements must be completed before the Membership Eval occurs.
A Secret Immediate Relative Majority vote with two-thirds quorum is required for the evaluation to be valid.
Neither absentee nor proxy votes are allowed.

\asubsubsubsection{Outcomes}
Members who pass the Membership Eval have the option to participate as an Active Member in the following year.
\\* \\*
If a member fails and has never passed a Membership Eval in the past, their membership will be revoked upon completion of the Membership Eval
If the member fails, but has previously passed a Membership Eval, they will move to Alumni Membership in bad standing, as defined in \ref{Alumni Membership Selection}, at the end of the Standard Operating Session.
In either case, the member forfeits their ability to participate as an Active Member in the following year.
\\* \\*
A member may be given a conditional to complete as a means of making up for missing requirements.
A conditional may be proposed by any member present at the Eval.
If the conditional is approved by the Evals Director, it is then voted on by the attending members as described in \ref{Voting}.
Each conditional consists of a set of additional requirements and a deadline for completing them.
Members who are given a conditional have their Eval decision deferred, and therefore maintain their current membership status until the conditional is resolved.
When the deadline expires, the conditional will be brought before E-Board, who will assess its completeness.
A conditional member who does not meet these additional requirements will have failed the Eval.

\asubsection{Active Membership Leave of Absence}

CSH recognizes the need for its members to take care of their personal well-being and will support them through the process of requesting a leave of absence.
House will also help reacclimate any returning member back to the culture of House upon their return.
Upon approval of a leave of absence request, the Evals Director is notified and the member's leave is applied immediately.
A member is also allowed to be physically present and also be on a leave of absence.

\asubsection{Leave of Absence Request}
A leave of absence request must include the following information about the member: name, email, phone number, start date, expected return date, and a reason for the leave.
The request is then given to a staff member of ResLife, excluding student employees, for approval.

At no point does E-Board need to be informed of any details relating to the reason for the leave.

\asubsection{Leave of Absence Duration}
A leave of absence can be granted for up to the length of one semester.

\asubsection{Leave of Absence Extension}
A leave of absence can be extended by submitting a new request.

\asubsection{Amount of House Dues}
The amount of dues for Active Members will be eighty dollars per academic semester.

\asubsection{Collection of Dues}
The collection period of house dues will be decided in conjunction with the Center for ResLife and Housing Operations.
During the dues collection period, dues for both semesters are collected through the member’s RIT bill.
Dues for any Alumni in good standing are to be collected when intention to pay is expressed to the Financial Director.

\asubsubsection{Rules for Giving Exceptions and Exemptions for House Dues}
Members may appeal their situation to the Financial Director or E-board in the case that the member is dissatisfied with the Financial Director's decision.
The Financial Director, or E-board, then decides whether their situation warrants an extension to the payment deadline and/or reduction of the required dues.
\\*\\*
If the appeal is denied, the member’s payment is considered delinquent and the member’s privileges are revoked until payment can be made.
All dues must be collected in full before the annual Membership Eval, as defined in \ref{Membership Evaluation}.
After this date, dues collection is suspended until the start of the next academic year.
\asubsection{Breakdown of Dues for Directorship Budgets}

	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

% The suggested total operating budget is $8360.
% This figure comes from having approximately 55 on-floor members with $80 per semester dues (totaling $8800) minus 5% set aside for Accumulated.
Dues collected from on-floor members are to be distributed into directorship budgets as shown in the above table.
Money allocated for Accumulated or collected from off-floor members is deposited into the CSH account and saved.

\asubsection{Expenditure Approval}
All CSH expenditures must be approved by the Financial Director and the director whose budget is going to be used for the expenditure.
Single expenditures may not exceed \$75 and Total Expenditures may not exceed \$100.
\\* \\*
If the above amounts are to be exceeded, the expenditure must be approved by an Immediate One-Half Vote at a House Meeting before the funds may be appropriated.
At the Financial Director's discretion, a Spending Committee meeting may be held in order to approve any purchase exceeding \$100, but not to exceed \$300.
A Two-Thirds Immediate Vote with twenty-five percent quorum is required to approve the purchase.
\\*\\*
For expenditures exceeding \$300 in total funding, a spending presentation must be presented at a House Meeting.
This presentation includes the funds required for the expenditure, inventory of required resources, and, if applicable, a timeline for completion.
\\* \\*
If an appropriate directorship cannot be determined for an expenditure, it is to be brought up for approval at a House Meeting as a miscellaneous expenditure and approved by an Immediate Relative Majority vote with fifty percent quorum, regardless of the amount.
This amount is to be directly subtracted from the general CSH account.

Members with On-Floor Status are eligible to live on the floor.
To be granted On-Floor Status, members may notify the Evals Director that they would like to come up for a vote.
The Evals Director will then bring them up for vote at the next Evals Meeting.

\asubsubsection{Off-Floor Status}
Members with Off-Floor Status do not have the right to live on the floor.
They still have access to all other privileges associated with their membership, and may still accumulate Housing Priority Points.

\asubsection{Housing Priority System}
The Housing Priority System is a means for determining the priority a member has in a housing issue or the assignment of available housing.
The member with top priority is the member with On-Floor Status and the most Housing Priority Points.
Housing Priority Points are accumulated once per Operating Session at the conclusion of the Membership Eval.
Each Active Member who passes the Membership Eval is granted two Housing Priority Points.

\asection{Evaluations Processes}
At the beginning of any Eval Process, the Evals Director must read the sections of the CSH Constitution regarding the relevant Eval Process.

\asubsection{Ranked Choice}
In a Ranked Choice Vote, voters rank the options by placing a '1' by their first choice, a '2' by their second choice, and so on, until they no longer wish to express any further preferences or run out of options.

The winning option is selected outright if it gains more than half the votes cast as a first preference.
If not, the option with the fewest number of first preference votes is eliminated and their votes move to the second preference marked on the ballots.
This process continues until one option has half of the votes cast and is elected.

\asection{Ties Between Vote Options}

\asubsection{With Pass/Fail}
If the number of votes cast for the pass option equals the number of votes cast for the fail option, then the vote has failed.

\asubsection{With Multiple Options}
