\article{Constitutional Structure}
\asection{House Charter}
The House Charter is a document drafted by the department of Residence Life, setting down the guidelines within which this House operates and from which it derives its authority.

\asection{Constitution}
The House Constitution is written and maintained by the House and defines the major aspects, goals, and governing structure of the house.  It is reviewed annually by the Department of Residence Life.  The House Constitution is comprised of three sections:  articles, by-laws, and guidelines.  Any non-semantic change to an article or by-law should be presented to the House by the Evaluations Committee for discussion.  After the discussion an immediate House vote is taken.  A quorum of fifty percent of the number of all House members eligible to vote must be present in order for the vote to be official.  A vote exceeding fifty percent of all House members casting a vote is required for the non-semantic change to be placed into the constitution.  Non-semantic changes to the guidelines and semantic changes to articles, by-laws, or guidelines are described in detail below.

\asubsection{Articles}
Articles define the major aspects of the House. Any semantic change to an article requires the change to be proposed in writing for discussion at a House Meeting. Any modifications made due to the discussion are added to the written proposal and the modified proposal is posted in the House during the week. The final proposal is presented the following week and ballots are distributed for a secret ballot House vote as described in \ref{Voting}, Voting. The ballots are collected for a minimum of a forty-eight hour period. A quorum of two-thirds of the number of all House members eligible to vote must cast ballots for the vote to be official. A vote equaling or exceeding two-thirds of the number of votes cast is required for the change to be placed into the constitution. An article may be overridden by an immediate House vote as described in \ref{Voting}, Voting. There must be a quorum of eighty-five percent of the number of all House members eligible to vote for the vote to be official. A vote equaling or exceeding ninety percent of the number of votes cast is required for the override to take effect.

\asubsection{By-Laws}
By-Laws define the more flexible aspects of the House. A by-law may expand on rules outlined in an article, but they must never contradict an article. Any semantic change to a by-law requires the change to be proposed in writing for discussion at a House Meeting. Any modifications made due to the discussion are added to the written proposal and the modified proposal is re-read prior to voting. The vote may be taken immediately or tabled one week at the discretion of the Executive Board. When the final proposal is ready to be voted upon, an immediate House vote will be taken as described in \ref{Voting}, Voting. A quorum of two-thirds of the number of all House members eligible to vote must cast a vote for the vote to be official. A vote equaling or exceeding two-thirds of the number of votes cast is required for the change to be placed into the constitution. A by-law may be overridden by an immediate House vote as described in \ref{Voting}, Voting. There must be a quorum of two-thirds of the number of all House members eligible to vote for the vote to be official. A vote equaling or exceeding two-thirds of the number of votes cast is required for the override to take effect.

\asubsection{Guidelines}
Guidelines define the standard operating procedure of the Committees of the House. Guidelines must never contradict any rule defined in either the articles or by-laws. They are drafted during the Executive Board Training Process by the Director of the respective Committee. Directors and Committees are expected to adhere to them, but if necessary, may deviate from a stated guideline. The guidelines will include:
\begin{itemize}
\item An explicit definition of what it means to be a member of the respective committee
\item Expectations of members in the committee
\item Goals of the committee for the operating year
\end{itemize}
The House must be notified of any deviation from a stated guideline. Any semantic or non-semantic change to a guideline is presented in writing to the Committee the guideline pertains to. The change must pass a simple majority vote within the members of the committee for it to be accepted. It is then presented to the Executive Board for review prior to placing it in the Constitution. The House is notified of the change at the following House meeting.

\asubsection{House Rules}
The House Rules capsulate a House Member's responsibilities and expectations. Members are required to sign the document signifying their acceptance of the membership requirements and expectations. All Resident and Non-Resident are required to sign the House Rules annually. Because the House Rules are extracted from the Constitution, any modifications to the contents of the House Rules must first be made to the Constitution. \ref{Operations of the Executive Board}, \ref{The House Rules}, describes which information is extracted from the Constitution and placed into the House Rules.

\article{Membership}
There are six major types of membership available to Computer Science House.  Each carries different qualifications, expectations, and privileges.  When describing the different memberships available, the following terms are used:
\begin{description}
\item[Qualifications:] What qualifications an applicant needs to apply.
\item[Selection:] The process by which an applicant gains membership.

\article{Voting}
There are two major ways to describe a vote: type of balloting and number of ballots required. A vote may be any combination of one type of balloting and one number of ballots required. There are also a number of definitions that need to be defined before the procedures can be defined.
\asection{Definitions}
\asubsection{Total Number of Possible Votes}
The Total Number of Possible Votes is defined as the number of possible ballots that can be cast in a vote. In a House vote, it is the sum of the number of all Resident and Non-Resident members. In a formal Executive Board vote, it is defined as the number of all voting Executive Board members. In a committee vote, it is defined as the number of members present at the current committee meeting.
\asubsection{Quorum}
A Quorum is defined as the minimum number of votes cast required for a vote to be official. It is usually defined as a fraction or a percentage of the total number of possible votes. A Quorum is reached if the number of votes cast, counting abstentions, is equal to or exceeding the minimum number of votes.
\asubsection{Absent Ballot}
An Absent Ballot is defined as any ballot that was not entered into the vote because a member eligible to vote did not vote or provide a means to indicate his or her vote. Absent Ballots are not counted towards a Quorum, but they are counted toward the total number of possible votes cast.
\asubsection{Proxy Ballot}
A Proxy Ballot is defined as any ballot that was cast by one member on behalf of another member. Any member may cast Proxy Ballots for another member who is unable to actually participate in the vote and only by written permission for the specific vote. Proxy votes are only permissible where explicitly stated.
\asubsection{Abstention}
An Abstention is defined as a vote indicating a neutral position in the vote. A means to abstain must always be provided in a vote. Abstentions are counted towards a quorum, but not towards the Total Number of Votes Cast used to determine if a vote passes or not.
\asubsection{Total Number of Votes Cast}
The Total Number of Votes Cast is defined as the total number of votes received for every voting option minus the number of abstentions.

\asection{Type of Balloting}
\asubsection{Secret Ballot}
When a Secret Ballot is called for, the person chairing the vote will see that ballots are made with a means to indicate every possible choice in the vote. They are then distributed to each House member eligible to cast a ballot in the vote, and collected in the indicated ballot box for a pre-specified period of time, the length time depending on the nature of the vote. This time period must be a minimum of forty-eight hours in length for any constitutional modification vote, candidate selection vote, or officer removal vote, and twenty-four hours in length for any other vote. The minimum length of the time period may be explicitly lengthened, but never shortened, in the text describing the actual vote. At the end of the voting period, the person chairing the vote collects the ballot box thus closing the voting. The votes are to be counted by person chairing the vote, and two House Members randomly selected, none of whom are directly involved in the vote. Being directly involved is defined as being a candidate in an election, or the accused or accuser in an impeachment. If every Executive Board member is directly involved in the vote, then a third House member is selected at random to count votes in place of the person chairing the vote. Any additional requirements to the voting procedure are described in the section pertaining to the actual vote.
\asubsection{Immediate Vote}
When an Immediate Vote is called for, the person chairing the vote will state all of the possible ways to vote and then call out each possibility one at a time. The chairing member will count the number of members casting their immediate vote for that possibility. When all of the possibilities have been voted upon, the totals will be tallied. Any additional requirements to the voting procedure are also described in the section pertaining to the actual vote.
\asection{Number of Ballots Required}
The Number of Ballots Required refers to the numbers required to achieve a quorum and for a vote to pass.  Below are listed three standard votes.  Numbers for non-standard votes are defined in the section describing the actual vote.
\asubsection{Simple Majority Vote}
In a Simple Majority Vote a Quorum is reached if the Total Number of Votes Cast is equal to or exceeds one-half the Total Number of Possible Votes. A selection in the vote passes if the number of votes cast for that selection is larger than the number of votes cast for every other selection individually.
\asubsection{Fifty Percent Vote}
In a Fifty Percent Vote a Quorum is reached if the Total Number of Votes Cast is equal to or exceeds fifty percent of the Total Number of Possible Votes. A selection in the vote passes if the number of votes cast for that selection exceeds fifty percent of the Total Number of Votes Cast.
\asubsection{Two-thirds Vote}
In a Two-thirds Vote a Quorum is reached if the Total Number of Votes Cast is equal to or exceeds two-thirds the Total Number of Possible Votes. A selection in the vote passes if the number of votes cast for the selection equals or exceeds two-thirds of the Total Number of Votes Cast.
\asubsection{Three Tiered Vote}
When voting on a set of three choices where each choice can be ranked in a definite order, a selection for either the lowest of highest option will only pass is the votes cast for that selection exceeds fifty percent of the Total Number of Votes Cast.  If neither the highest or lowest selection reaches fifty percent, the middle option will then be passed.  In a Three-Tiered Vote, a Quorum is reached if the Total Number of Votes Cast is equal to or exceeds two-thirds of the Total Number of Possible Votes. 
\asection{Ties Between Vote Selections}
The action to take on a tie depends on whether or not the vote was a pass/fail vote or a multiple choice vote. In a pass/fail vote, if the number of votes cast for the pass selection equals the number of votes cast for the fail selection, then the vote failed. In a multiple choice vote, if multiple selections may pass, then a tie does not present a problem, however, if only one selection may pass, then the vote must either be recast or tabled according to the discretion of the person chairing the vote. In the event of a tie in an Executive Board vote, the Chairman may cast the tie-breaking vote.
