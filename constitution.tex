\article{Constitutional Structure}

\asection{House Charter}
The House Charter is a document drafted by the department of Residence Life, setting down the guidelines within which this House operates and from which it derives its authority.

\asection{Constitution}
The House Constitution is written and maintained by the House and defines the major aspects, goals, and governing structure of the house. It is reviewed annually by the Department of Residence Life. The House Constitution is comprised of two sections: articles and by-laws. Articles define the major aspects of the House. A by-law may expand on rules outlined in an article, but they must never contradict a Constitutional article.

\asubsection{ Non-Semantic Changes}
Any non-semantic change to the Constitution should be presented to the House for discussion. After the discussion an immediate House vote is taken. A quorum of fifty percent of the number of all House members eligible to vote must be present in order for the vote to be official. A vote exceeding fifty percent of all House members casting a vote is required for the non-semantic change to be placed into the constitution.

\asubsection{Semantic Changes}
Any semantic change to the Constitution requires the change to be proposed in writing for discussion at a House Meeting. Any modifications made due to the discussion are added to the written proposal and the modified proposal is posted in the House during the week. The final proposal is presented the following week and ballots are distributed for a ballot House vote as described in \ref{Balloted Vote}. The ballots are collected for a minimum of a forty-eight hour period. A quorum of two-thirds of the number of all House members eligible to vote must cast ballots for the vote to be official. A vote equaling or exceeding two-thirds of the number of votes cast is required for the change to be placed into the constitution. The Constitution may be overridden by an immediate House vote as described in \ref{Immediate Vote}. There must be a quorum of eighty-five percent of the number of all House members eligible to vote for the vote to be official. A vote equaling or exceeding ninety percent of the number of votes cast is required for the override to take effect.

\asection{Types of Voting}
\asubsection{Balloted Vote}
\asubsubsection{Method of Vote} 
Votes are cast on paper ballots, which provide a means to indicate every possible option in the vote. A ballot is then distributed to each House member eligible to cast a vote and collected in the designated ballot box for a pre-specified length of time. At the end of the voting period, the person chairing the vote collects the ballots, closing the voting period. The Vote Counters then tally the results.
\asubsubsection{Voting Period} 
For constitutional modification, candidate selection, and officer removal votes, the voting period must be at least forty-eight (48) hours in length. For any other type of vote, the voting period must be at least twenty-four (24) hours. The minimum length of the voting period may be explicitly lengthed, but never shortened, in the text describing the actual vote.
\asubsection{Immediate Vote}
\asubsubsection{Method of Vote} 
The person chairing the vote will state all possible ways to vote, then call out each possibility one at a time. The chairing member will count the number of members casting their immediate vote for that possibility.
\asubsubsection{Voting Period} 
An immediate vote lasts as long as it takes for all votes to be tallied.
\asubsection{Secret Immediate Vote}
\asubsubsection{Method of Vote} 
The person chairing the vote will state all possible ways to vote, then call out each possibility one at a time. Votes are kept anonymous. The chairing member and Vote Counters will count the number of members casting their immediate vote for that possibility.
\asubsubsection{Voting Period}
A secret immediate vote lasts as long as it takes for all votes to be tallied.
\asubsection{Batch Vote}
When a Batch Vote is called for by the chair, a subset of the voting docket may be amended to a single vote. A Two-Thirds Immediate Vote is required to allow a Batch Vote to take place. If the call for Batch Vote passes, the subset may then be voted on, otherwise the docket remains unchanged.

\asection{Number of Votes Required}
The Number of Votes Required refers to the numbers required to achieve a quorum and for a vote to pass. Below are listed four standard votes. Numbers for non-standard votes are defined in the section describing the actual vote.
\asubsection{Simple Majority}
In a Simple Majority Vote, a Quorum is reached if the Total Number of Votes Cast is equal to or exceeds one-half the Total Number of Possible Votes. An option in the vote passes if the number of votes cast for that option is larger than the number of votes cast for every other option individually.
\asubsection{Fifty Percent}
In a Fifty Percent Vote, a Quorum is reached if the Total Number of Votes Cast is equal to or exceeds one-half the Total Number of Possible Votes. An option in the vote passes if the number of votes cast for that option exceeds fifty percent of the Total Number of Votes Cast.
\asubsection{Two-Thirds}
In a Two-thirds Vote, a Quorum is reached if the Total Number of Votes Cast is equal to or exceeds two-thirds the Total Number of Possible Votes. An option in the vote passes if the number of votes cast for the option equals or exceeds two-thirds of the Total Number of Votes Cast.
\asubsection{Three Tiered}
When voting on a set of three choices where each choice can be ranked in a definite order, a selection for either the lowest of highest option will only pass is the votes cast for that selection exceeds fifty percent of the Total Number of Votes Cast. If neither the highest or lowest selection reaches fifty percent, the middle option will then automatically be passed. In a Three-Tiered Vote, a Quorum is reached if the Total Number of Votes Cast is equal to or exceeds two-thirds of the Total Number of Possible Votes.

\asection{Ties Between Vote Options}
\asubsection{With Pass/Fail}
If the number of votes cast for the pass option equals the number of votes cast for the fail option, then the vote has failed.
\asubsection{With Multiple Options}
If multiple options may pass, a tie does not present a problem. If only one option may pass, then the vote must be recast or tabled at the discretion of the person chairing the vote. In the event of a tie in an Executive Board vote, the Chairman may cast the tie-breaking vote.
